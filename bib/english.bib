Edition number is set by [Paul Cooper](https://www.regencydances.org/paper003.php) with the following reasoning: this book cannot be neither first edition from 1816 (because [advertisement in _The Gentleman's Magazine_](https://books.google.com/books?id=hLAUAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA612) and [advertisement in _The Repository of Arts_](https://books.google.com/books?id=TgNHAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA356) say it has 232 pages and does not have any quadrilles — this book contains 257 numbered pages and contains some quadrilles), nor the second edition (the footnote of the first page of the index says that the second edition index lacked quadrilles — and the index in this book has quadrilles in the index). This is unlikely to be the third edition: in _Critiques_ section it mentions the review of _The Correct Method of German and French Waltzing_ published in December 1817 issue of the _European Magazine_; the third edition of “A Companion to the Ball Room” [was published in 1817](https://books.google.com/books?id=Otv_ITA33_EC&pg=PA112). Hence, this is assumed to be the fourth edition. Dated circa 1820 by the library which is considered as reliable dating by Paul Cooper.},
