This is unlikely to be the third edition: in _Critiques_ section it mentions the review of _The Correct Method of German and French Waltzing_ published in December 1817 issue of the _European Magazine_; the third edition of “A Companion to the Ball Room” [was published in 1817](https://books.google.com/books?id=Otv_ITA33_EC&pg=PA112).
